brayjl engine

# about
The brayjl engine is meant to be an engine that I can use in order to make games without the need of having to set everything up from scratch again when I just want to get to the game making part of my application.

As it currently stands, it only supports Windows with VS2022 as those are the tools that I personally use to make applications.

# install
Installation was designed to be very easy with this engine.
First clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/BJL156/brayjl
```
After change directories into the newly created `brayjl` folder:
```
cd brayjl
```
Then finally to build the project run the `setup.bat`:
```
setup.bat
```
Lastly, execute victory dance as the project is completely setup at this point.
